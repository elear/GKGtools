=head1 NAME

gkgls - list keys installed on GKG.NET.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  gkgls [ -c conffile ] domain [domain...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

gkgls prints DS records, keytags, digests, and max signature lifetimes
that are installed for the domains specified on the command line.

This program reads the username, password, and optionally maxsiglife
used to call out to GKG.NET.  By default, these are stored in a file:
/etc/gkg.conf.

It takes the following form:

  username=yournamehere
  password=secrethere
  maxsiglife=nnnnn (integer time in seconds)


If maxsiglife is ommitted, a value of 3456000 is used.
