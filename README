GKGtools version 1.0b1
=========================

Earliest version of GKG.NET tools one can use to update DS records via
their RESTful interface.  Use at your OWN risk.

Currently several programs are installed:

 o gkgadd expects a single DNSKEY, as output from the ods-enforcer, and
   adds it to the list of DS keys on GKG.NET.
 o gkgls domain [domain...] lists out the DS keys for given domains
 o gkgrm domain HASH removes a DS key matching a given hash
 o ods-wrapper - this is an EARLY version of the wrapper one would use
                 from ods-enforcer.  IT HAS BUGS.  Do not call directly
		 from enforcer yet!!!

Each of these programs takes an optional [-c conffile].

The conf file contains the following:

username=GKGusername
password=GKGpassword
maxsiglife=nnnn
admin=somebody@example.com
enforcer=/usr/local/sbin/ods-enforcer

maxsiglife is optional, and the default value is 3456000.

Note that admin and enforcer are currently only used by a OpenDNSSEC wrapper.
